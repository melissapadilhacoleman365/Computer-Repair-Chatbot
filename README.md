#Skript how Watson Assistant & Watson Discovery can work together 

Melissa: 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. I have put together a generic demo so you can understand the simplicity for users. 


This demo shows how watson discovery and watson assistant work together. 


Chatbot: How can I help you? 


Melissa- Here we can ask the chatbot any question. For example, a topic that can be found in the FAQ section can be answered easily. Let's use the example- how to install software? 


User: How do I install software? 


Chatbot: If you solution is not resolved a ticket can be opened? Do you want to create ticket?


Melissa- Watson Discovery recognises the customer's request and scans the page to understand the request.  Watson Discovery scans the web page and is able to return different results. Watson learns which are the most relevant and can provide more accurate answers to specific questions over time. 


If the user's question is not answered, they can open a ticket. This is then attached to the ticketing system. Watson Assistant is relevant here to understand how the customer wants to proceed. 


User: Yes


Chatbot: What severtiy do you want for your new ticket? 


Melissa- The user chooses the severity level.  


User: High


Chatbot: A ticket has been opened with ticket number, urgency, time result.


Watson then returns a summary for use, including how long it will take for a response from the team.
